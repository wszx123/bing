This day is dedicated to appreciating these tiny, agile birds and their role as a pollinator in our ecosystem. Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backward. Emily Dickinson aptly describes their swift movement: 'A Route of Evanescence / With a revolving Wheel—.' Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar.","date":"Sep 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Humming along","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240907_SantaCruzHummer%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"04a9c4b0605756bac54cd2a3c13a0331","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
