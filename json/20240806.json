This pleasant crescent in the Pacific Ocean lies in the 'Alalākeiki Channel between the Hawaiian islands of Maui and Kaho'olawe. The islet is all that remains of a volcano that erupted about 230,000 years ago. According to Hawaiian mythology, Pele the fire goddess was in love with a man named Mo'o. The trouble was that Mo'o was in love with another woman. Pele's revenge was typically violent: She cut her rival in two, her body becoming Molokini, while her head became Pu'u Olai, a cinder cone on Maui.","date":"Aug 6, 2024","bsTitle":"A very pleasant crescent","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240806_MolokiniHawaii%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b755bf9b7bff570494e762937466fe4f","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
