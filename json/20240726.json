What makes these Games unique is the opening ceremony, which will be held outside a stadium for the first time. Participants will parade along the Seine on a flotilla of boats, passing under the Pont Neuf, pictured here, and cheered by spectators lining both banks. Paris is no stranger to historic firsts; the 1900 Games included women competing for the first time, although they made up only 22 of 997 athletes.","date":"Jul 26, 2024","bsTitle":"Let the Games begin!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240726_PontNeuf%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"7b96689c34bc0da1aca2ab62f7ec7c0b","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
