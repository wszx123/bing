This part of China is known for its karst landscape, which includes towering arches, extensive caves, and other rock formations. These limestone bridges are named after three dragons: Tianlong (Sky Dragon), Heilong (Black Dragon), and Qinglong (Azure Dragon), which is the tallest at 922 feet. Visitors can explore the mossy gorge beneath and the wider Wulong Karst National Geology Park, including the 9,337-foot Furong Cave with its huge limestone stalactites. Standing beneath these magnificent natural bridges, you can't help but be humbled by the sheer power of time and nature.","date":"Aug 3, 2024","bsTitle":"Towering over Wulong","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240803_WulongKarst%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"04340b14ec70f48ae739f5815fc62223","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
