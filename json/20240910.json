Stretching nearly 8 miles, it was Europe's longest bridge when it opened in 1998, built to ease traffic on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal. This cable-stayed bridge was designed to be earthquake and wind-resistant; its deck is not fixed to the pylons, and it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Its opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India.","date":"Sep 10, 2024","bsTitle":"From skyline to water","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240910_BridgeLisbon%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"fa6eab38aac985df4c96e307cadbe2e3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
