The Hmong people, an ethnic minority who migrated here from China in the 19th century, have meticulously carved these cascading hills for generations. Mù Cang Chải boasts approximately 5,500 acres of terraced rice fields, which flood with water between September and October, reflecting the surrounding mountains and sky. Visitors can also indulge in Vietnamese dishes and colorful souvenirs at the local markets or climb to the peak of La Pan Tan village to enjoy views of this stunning landscape.","date":"Jul 7, 2024","bsTitle":"Rice and shine","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240707_YenBaiTerraces%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"037366938b4bea028adb23addb583574","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
