The fortress, on the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece, was built by the Venetians in the early 13th century as a trading post and defensive bastion, protecting the coastline from invaders. Its Bourtzi tower, an extension of the fortress standing on a small islet, was once connected to the main castle by a stone bridge.","date":"Jul 23, 2024","bsTitle":"Echoes of history","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240723_MethoniCastle%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"0042011f964dddb3d7c74ec707e8752c","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
