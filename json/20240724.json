Today, we are celebrating the unique bond between cousins. Cousins Day offers the perfect opportunity to reminisce about those shared adventures, secrets, and the countless memories that have brought you closer together. First cousins share about 12.5% of their DNA; this could explain why you often have so much love and understanding with them. So, go ahead and make some plans with your cousins, whether it is a picnic or a shared meal at your favorite local haunt. And while you are at it, don't forget to pose for a photo, much like this group of Swaledale sheep in the North Yorkshire dales of England. Chances are, there are at least a few cousins in this flock.","date":"Jul 24, 2024","bsTitle":"Baa-utiful family","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240724_SheepCousins%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"580de4b722fa92e6b75d86fcf4fe26f3","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
