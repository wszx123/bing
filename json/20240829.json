This town is not for the faint-hearted: There's a 160-foot drop down to the Toronell and Fluvia rivers, which converge at the base of the cliff. Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador.","date":"Aug 29, 2024","bsTitle":"A Catalan cliffhanger","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240829_CastellfollitSpain%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a263ecb83fde9d12ee9ed544e4d7ed4a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
