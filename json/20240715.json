Japan has 14,125 islands and has over 18,400 miles of coastline, so it's no wonder the sea plays such a key role in its culture. It provides much of the country's food and is vital for trading and communicating with other nations.","date":"Jul 15, 2024","bsTitle":"Seas the day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240715_TateishiPark%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"da604435b063c881402f311718f7b5b1","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
