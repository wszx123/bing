The museum is 70 feet underground, beneath the memorial's waterfall pools in the footprints of the fallen towers. The names of those who died in the 2001 terrorist attacks and in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing are listed on bronze parapets surrounding these huge reflecting pools. Seven stories below the memorial, the museum tells the story of 9/11 through exhibits, artifacts, historical records, and personal accounts, remembering the victims and those who risked their lives to save others.","date":"Sep 11, 2024","bsTitle":"Patriot Day","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240911_ManhattanMemorial%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"b2415c44cfa5e46c2254c3f5d76570a5","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
