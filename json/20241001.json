The park, in central California's Sierra Nevada range, has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers, and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year.","date":"Oct 1, 2024","bsTitle":"Dome sweet dome","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241001_HalfDomeYosemite%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"899ecfdda89d68a76830eb15f5584c16","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
