In the Middle Ages, a town grew up around a church dedicated to St. Geminianus (San Gimignano in Italian). As well as being a popular stop for pilgrims on their way to Rome, the town prospered thanks to its trade in local Vernaccia wine and in saffron, which is grown in the nearby hills. However, when the Black Death struck in 1348, half the population was lost, slowing the town's development and preserving its medieval character to this day.","date":"Jul 30, 2024","bsTitle":"A medieval Manhattan","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240730_GimignanoTuscany%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"8e9b5b59679e24de92f4a9deebc78ace","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
