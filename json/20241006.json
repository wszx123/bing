Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates back to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defense with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilization inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE.","date":"Oct 6, 2024","bsTitle":"The stone town of Tuscany","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20241006_SoranoItaly%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"ee375f0481222683970e7a6b9f80c690","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
