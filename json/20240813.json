Pictured behind cliffs separating it from the Adriatic Sea is the park's Telašćica Bay, which stretches inland over 6 miles and is the largest natural harbor in the Adriatic. Dotted with islets and surrounded by small islands, its dramatic cliffs tower more than 520 feet above sea level and are known locally as the 'stene.' Other features of the park include 25 secluded beaches, as well as the therapeutic Mir salt lake known for its healing properties. So, the next time you're in the mood for island-hopping, come to Telašćica, where the land and sea play an endless game of tag.","date":"Aug 13, 2024","bsTitle":"Adriatic heights","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240813_DugiOtokCroatia%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"e48914d5175e5e848bdba6ba8900214a","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
