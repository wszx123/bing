Over 4,000 athletes with a range of disabilities from all around the world will meet in the French capital to compete across 549 different events. For its first time hosting the Summer Paralympics, the city has got something special in store for the opening ceremony. Delegations from 184 nations will parade down the iconic Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde, rather than entering a stadium. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. Twenty-three nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and Para athletics.","date":"Aug 28, 2024","bsTitle":"Games on","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240828_ParalympicsParis%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"a19ed716c042f79b10948e93bbd56638","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
