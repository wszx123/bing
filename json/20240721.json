This serene village plays a modest role in the islands' fishing industry, with traditional wooden boats, known as dhows, etching patterns across the waters. The local dhow builders offer a glimpse into an artisanal craft that has sailed through generations. Venture deeper and you'll find lush spice farms where the air tingles with the scent of nutmeg and black pepper. Here, traditional Swahili dishes, including nyama choma, a roasted meat dish, and samaki wa kaupaka, fish with coconut sauce, blend spices with the bounty of the sea and land. As the sun sets, bonfires flicker into life and the island pulses with Taarab, a fusion of African, Arabic, and Indian music. With so much to see, Zanzibar proves that variety really is the spice of life.","date":"Jul 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Smooth sailing","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240721_ZanzibarBoats%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4ce8ec965b750b014e09fe4c3a98029d","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
