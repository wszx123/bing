Here, towering red rock formations reach skyward, and cliffs and caves feature petroglyphs created by the Ciénaga, Diaguita, and other Indigenous cultures more than 1,000 years ago. This 830-square-mile park in La Rioja province is also home to some of the oldest dinosaur remains ever found. Moreover, nature's beauty is shown in the local flora, like xeric shrubs and cactus, and fauna. Guanacos, hares, and foxes roam free, while condors, white-throated cacholotes, and sandy gallitos grace the skies above this UNESCO World Heritage Site.","date":"Jul 9, 2024","bsTitle":"Towering Talampaya","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240709_TalampayaNP%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"c22add907b3263aef6e5e2c0b0618715","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
