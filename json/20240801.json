Kaptai Lake in Rangamati District is home to the floating market of seasonal fruit seen in today's image. The lake was created in the early 1960s to generate hydropower, submerging not just land and the palace of the king of the Chakmas, Bangladesh's largest ethnic minority group, but a way of life, displacing 100,000 people. Sixty years on and the landscape has changed. This buoyant bazaar has become a livelihood, as farmers navigate their wooden vessels along the bank to engage with eager buyers. You leave with a bag full of fresh fruit or just a bunch of unforgettable memories, whatever floats your boat.","date":"Aug 1, 2024","bsTitle":"There's a boatload of bargains here","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240801_KaptaiLake%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"266e486c7cc8bfa893f4a3e63163b352","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
