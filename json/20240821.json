Habitats range from arid regions to tropical rainforests. Because these islands are so isolated, many of the species that live here are not found anywhere else in the world. One species found in abundance is the Nazca booby, pictured here on Wolf Island. The name might raise a few eyebrows, but it actually comes from the Spanish word 'bobo,' meaning clown, because of the birds' clumsy demeanor when they're walking.","date":"Aug 21, 2024","bsTitle":"Waiting to 'Galápa-go'","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240821_NazcaBooby%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"868704fd3182d5fd6f5fcc0b9337b2f9","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
