On the North Queensland coast of Australia, encircled by dense foliage, is Noah Beach. A fascinating blend of two ecosystems, here the Daintree Rainforest seamlessly meets the azure waters of the Coral Sea. This secluded area of the Daintree National Park boasts a stretch of soft, golden sands while elsewhere there are towering trees, lush ferns, and other plant species unique to the area. The Daintree is believed to have been around for up to 180 million years, making it the oldest tropical rainforest in the world. It is also Australia's largest uninterrupted stretch of tropical rainforest and home to rare species like Bennett's tree-kangaroo, found nowhere else on our planet.","date":"Jul 5, 2024","bsTitle":"A coastal encounter","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240705_NoahBeach%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"3184f3c8f6404209fb2d764a42b49ff7","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
