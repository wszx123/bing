Schönebaum/plainpicture","desc":"Among untamed rainforests, rice paddies, and steep ravines lies the village of Ubud, the cultural heart of Bali, Indonesia. According to legend, a Hindu priest, Rsi Markandaya, arrived at the island of Bali in the 8th century, discovering an area abundant in medicinal herbs and plants. The village's name derives from the word 'ubad,' meaning medicine. Nestled within the verdant landscape, the village is rich in Hindu temples and local mythology. The mythical character seen in today’s image is Barong, a panther-like creature, the king of spirits, and a symbol of good fortune and prosperity. The Barong dance, performed in a decorated animal mask, is native to Bali.","date":"Jun 30, 2024","bsTitle":"You won't forget 'Ubud' it!","quiz":"/search?q=Bing+homepage+quiz&filters=WQOskey:%22HPQuiz_20240630_UbudBali%22&FORM=HPQUIZ","wp":true,"hsh":"4bd85fb3d7273ef1b892bf5e3c848e31","drk":1,"top":1,"bot":1,"hs":[]}],"tooltips":{"loading":"Loading...","previous":"Previous image","next":"Next image","walle":"This image is not available to download as wallpaper.","walls":"Download this image.
